 Description : Library for addressing Adafruit Digital RGB LED pixels
               (product ID #322, specifically the newer WS2801-based type)
               from a computer.  This is the host PC-side code written in
               Java and intended for use with Processing sketches (see
               included examples for use); requires a USB-connected Arduino
               microcontroller running the accompanying LED streaming code.

 History     : 25/09/2011  Adapted from earlier p9813 C library.
 			 : 08/05/2014  Modified by Thaddeus Robertson thad@bareawe.net
 			 			   -- added BGR color order to cater for led-studion
 			 			      LED WS2801 50mm modules
 			 			      see http://www.led-studien.de/docs/RGB-Pixel_Datenblatt.pdf
 			 			      
 			 			   -- modified power calculation settings to suit a specific
 			 			      application utilising the above pixels at 24V

	// Current consumption of the LEDs scales very near linearly with
	// the PWM duty cycle -- close enough that it can reasonably be
	// left out of the model.  However...

	// "Combination" currents when measured don't equal the sum of the
	// component currents.  For example, a pixel with either red or
	// green active will match the above readings, but a pixel with both
	// red AND green active will draw slightly less current than the
	// prior two figures combined.  This phenomenon generally occurs
	// when the LED strand is inadequately powered, it appears in all
	// combinations (R+G, G+B, R+B, R+G+B) and is compounded in the
	// R+G+B case.  The model takes this into account...in testing,
	// the estimated current figure is typically within 1% of an actual
	// metered result.  However however...

	// You may sometimes get meter readings that are +/-3% off the
	// estimate.  Part of this is simply because the combination model
	// isn't perfect.  But it's also because the estimates are derived
	// from averages of the whole LED strand, but manufacturing
	// tolerances are such that each pixel is in reality slightly
	// different, and this will be most apparent with certain lighting
	// combintations.  Given more frames over more time, the overall
	// measured average should converge closer to the code's estimate.
